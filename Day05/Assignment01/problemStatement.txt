🚀 Doraemon's Secret Gadget Mission! 🛠️
Nobita has accidentally erased Doraemon’s gadget inventory file! Doraemon needs your help to recreate the file and ensure it's error-free using Python.
 
📝 Problem Statement
Doraemon stores all his secret gadgets in a file called gadgets.txt. The file stores gadget names along with their descriptions.
 
Your task is to create a Python program that:
 
Takes a list of gadgets and their descriptions from command-line arguments.
Saves this data in a file (gadgets.txt).
Handles possible errors gracefully (such as missing arguments, file permission errors, or invalid input).
Reads back the data and displays it in a fun format.
📌 Input Format
The user runs the script with command-line arguments like this:
 

python doraemon_gadgets.py "Bamboo Copter: A flying gadget" "Anywhere Door: Travel anywhere instantly"
🎯 Your Task
Accept command-line arguments (except the script name).
Handle exceptions:
If no gadgets are given, show an error.
Handle file writing/reading errors.
Write the data to a file named gadgets.txt.
Read from the file and display it nicely.
🔍 Hints to Help You!
✨ Hint 1: Use the sys module to read command-line arguments.
✨ Hint 2: Use try-except to catch errors (like missing arguments).
✨ Hint 3: Open files in write (w) mode and then read (r) mode.
✨ Hint 4: Read and display the data in a fun and creative format!
 
🎭 Example Run
Running the Script
python doraemon_gadgets.py "Time Cloth: Rewinds or fast-forwards time" "Memory Bread: Helps memorize things"
